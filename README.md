# EOY Flow Challenge - Rules

## Overview

The **EOY Flow Challenge for Devs** is an exciting competition where developer teams will create two innovative projects: **PROJECT INITIALIZER TOOL** and **SNIPPET MANAGER TOOL**. Teams will utilize Flow for both coding and integrating solutions, employing a unique technology stack.

## Project Structure

1. **Project Components**:
   - Each project will be divided into two separate repositories:
     - **API Repository**: Responsible for the backend implementation using Flask.
     - **UI Repository**: Responsible for the frontend implementation using VUE.

2. **Team Formation**:
   - Developer groups will be created for each project.
   - Teams will be formed based on the technology stack they choose to work with (Flask for backend and VUE for frontend).

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: VUE.js
- **Backend**: Flask

This technology stack may differ from what participants are accustomed to, providing an opportunity to learn and adapt to new tools and frameworks.

## Challenge Rules

1. **Team Registration**:
   - Each group must register for one of the two projects: PROJECT INITIALIZER TOOL or SNIPPET MANAGER TOOL.

2. **Development Process**:
   - Teams must use Flow for coding and integrating their solutions. This includes utilizing Flow's capabilities for generating code snippets and managing project structures.

3. **Repository Management**:
   - Each project must maintain separate repositories for API and UI. Teams should follow best practices for version control and collaboration.

4. **Documentation**:
   - Teams are required to document their development process, including setup instructions, code explanations, and any challenges faced. This documentation should be included in each repository.

5. **Submission**:
   - Each team must submit their completed projects by the specified deadline. All code should be pushed to the respective repositories, and a final demonstration should be prepared.

6. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - Projects will be evaluated based on functionality, code quality, adherence to the rules, documentation, and creativity in utilizing Flow within the solutions.

7. **Prizes**:
   - Prizes will be awarded to the top-performing teams based on the evaluation criteria.
